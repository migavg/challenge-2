# Challenge-2

## Description

This week‚Äôs challenge was to create a portfolio.

Using HTML with CSS I have created a very simple web page that will showcase applications that I will create in the future.

While creating this site I struggled with setting up the layout of the web page alot.

Flexbox was a completely new concept for me and it took some time to understand what each property did and where to apply it. Even now I‚Äôm quite certain that there is much that I still have to learn from it.

This was also the first project in which I received help from a fellow classmate. I learned that having someone else give input and constructive criticism really goes a long way. Collaboration can really have an impact on your projects.

Unfortunately due to some learning curves I was not able to implement a responsive layout when resizing the browser. I believe that media queries were to be used. 

At the moment most of the content I have is mostly placeholder due to the fact that I am a beginner, but I hope to learn and grow as a developer to make my page stand out.

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

![badmath](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/nielsenjared/badmath)

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
